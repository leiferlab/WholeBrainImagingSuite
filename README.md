# WholeBrainImagingSuite

This is a collection of software components used in the Nguyen et al Whole-brain calcium imaging with cellular resolution in freely behaving Caenorhabditis elegans, PNAS, 2015: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/12/23/1507110112

So far it consists of the core C code used for imaging behavior and for real-time fluorescent feedback.  The majority of this repo is  submodules to other leiferlab repositories.


To be added shortly are different LabView  components for acquiring 3D image stacks and MATLAB code required for viewing.


This is a work in progress. We are actively collating various components and will include them here. So please check back in the coming days.
