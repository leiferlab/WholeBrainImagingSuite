# WholeBrainImagingSuite

This is a collection of software components used in the Nguyen et al Whole-brain calcium imaging with cellular resolution in freely behaving Caenorhabditis elegans, PNAS, 2015: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/12/23/1507110112

Different code components involved LabView (z-feedback and fluorescence image acquisition), C (xy feedback) and MATLAB (analysis).

The majority of this repo will be submodules to other publically accessible repositories.

Note that this is a work in progress. We are actively collating various components and will include them here. So please check back soon.
